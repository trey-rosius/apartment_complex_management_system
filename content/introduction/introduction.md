# Welcome to the Apartment Complex Management System(ACMS) Serverless Application

## Concept

In this course, we are going to be using Serverless technology to build a system where Building owners can:

- Create personal accounts.
- Register the buildings(name, address, number of apartments etc) they own.
- Assign and keep Caretakers to manage each of those buildings.
- Keep track of the tenants occupying the apartments in the building.
- Keep track of occupied and vacant apartments, bookings,payments, and a lot more in each of their building.
- And other useful information thatâ€™ll provide more insights on the management of their buildings.

We'll build and deploy a serverless GraphQL API with Appsync,Cdk and Typescript.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure you have these dependencies installed before proceeding.

- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)
- [AWS ACCOUNT AND USER](https://cdkworkshop.com/15-prerequisites/200-account.html)
- [Node Js](https://cdkworkshop.com/15-prerequisites/300-nodejs.html)
- [AWS CDK ToolKit](https://cdkworkshop.com/15-prerequisites/500-toolkit.html)
- [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/) is a fully managed serverless service that makes it easy to develop GraphQL APIs in the cloud. It handles the heavy lifting of managing a complex GraphQL backend infrastructure, securely connecting to data sources, adding caches to improve performance, subscriptions to support real-time updates, and client-side data stores that keep offline clients in sync.
- GraphQL provides a flexible typed data query language for APIs as well as a runtime to fulfill these queries
- The [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) is an open-source software development framework to define your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages
