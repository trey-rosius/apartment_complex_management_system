### Testing `createApartmentBooking` Endpoint

Sign in to your appsync account on the aws console, navigate to your project and run the following mutation.

```graphql
mutation create {
createApartmentBooking(input: {apartmentId: "2F6hDMkdfeX4wQau7Bhoi7cOuAH",
 bookingStatus: PENDING, endDate: "2022-10-22", startDate: "2022-09-22", 
userId: "[test1@gmail.com](mailto:test1@gmail.com)"})
}
```

Change the values of the `apartmentId` and `userId` to match those in your dynamoDB table.

If the mutation runs successfully, a `true` is returned.

If we go to `processSqsBooking` lambda and look at its logs, we see that it has received a message.

Then, the lambda would save this message into dynamoDB.

If you attempt to run the mutation again with same values for `userId` and `apartmentId`, meaning that the same user wants to book the same apartment, with a previous `PENDING` booking status already in the system, the mutation fails.

`You already have a pending booking for this apartment`

Please create multiple users and create bookings with each of those users. Weâ€™ll be needing them in the next step.

After creating multiple bookings for an apartment, we want to give the building owner(Admin), a way to retrieve all bookings for each of their apartments, in-order to `APPROVE` or `DENY` a booking.
