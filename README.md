## Welcome to the Apartment Complex Management System(ACMS) Serverless Application

## Concept

ACMS is an attempt at using Serverless technology to build a system where building owners can:

- Create an account.
- Register the buildings(name, address, number of apartments etc) that they own.
- Assign and keep Caretakers to manage each of those buildings.
- Keep track of the tenants occupying the apartments in the building.
- Keep track of occupied and vacant apartments, bookings,payments, and a lot more in each of their building.
- And other useful information thatâ€™ll provide more insights on the management of their buildings.

## ERD(Entity Relationship Diagram)

### Entities

- Buildings(A building has many apartments)
- Apartments(Apartments are in buildings)
- Bookings(Each apartment can have multiple pending bookings. Once a booking has been approved, payment can be made. )
- Notifications(Light, Water, internet bills due)
- Payments(Before payment, booking status equals Approved. After payment, booking status equals PAID )
- Users(Administrators,CareTakers, Tenants)
